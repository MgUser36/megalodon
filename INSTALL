You need ocaml. You don't need make.

There are two scripts: makebytecode and makeopt.
Try makeopt. If it doesn't work, try makebytecode instead.

You might need to edit these scripts of ocamlc and/or ocamlopt is not in your PATH.

The command line options are:

-v <verbosity> : Set the verbosity level.
-I <sigfilenames> : Include these signature files. Signature files are not allowed to have proofs in them.
-owned <ownedfilename> : This is a file generated from Proofgold's reportowned command.
-pfg : Output a Proofgold version of the document.
-hf  : Use the HF theory (instead of HOTG-Egal theory)
-hoas : Use the HOAS theory (instead of HOTG-Egal theory)
-mizar : Use the HOTG-Mizar theory (instead of HOTG-Egal theory)
-indout <indexfilename> : Create an output this index file.
-ind <indexfilename> : Use this index file.
-reportpfcomplexity : Output information about a "proof complexity" (this was used to suggest the relative sizes of treasures).
-reporteachitem : Note when each item is being processed.
